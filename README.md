This is a Game I created in [Unity](https://unity.com/) inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&ab_channel=GameMaker%27sToolkit) youtube video. 

I have made many additions to the Game.

The Game Includes:
- Main Menu
- Options Menu
- Pause Menu
- Keeping High Score on the Hard Drive
- Moving Start Screen
- Clouds (using the Particle System)
- Sound Effects
- Animations
- Terrain Spawner
- Pipe Spawner
