I made plenty additions to the Game.
Some of them include:
- Terrain Spawner
- Main Menu
- Options Menu
- Pause Menu
- Keeping High Score on the Hard Drive
- Moving Start Screen
- Clouds (using the Particle System)
- Sound Effects
- Animations
- Other tweaks in code (eg. Score can't go up after Game Over, Game Over when Bird is off-screen, ...)
