# FlarpyBlorb

This is a Game created in [Unity](https://unity.com/) inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&ab_channel=GameMaker%27sToolkit) youtube video.

# The Game

A quick **Overview** of what the game looks like:

**You can press 'Space' to Flap and Start the game!**

**Score increases every time the Bird flies through the Pipes!**

**If the Bird hits a pipe, it's Game Over :(**
